##About Anime Bracket

###What is it?

As the name suggest, Anime Bracket exists to hold single-elimination style tournaments with characters from various Japanese media (despite the name, it doesn't _need_ to be anime). It's great for settling (or creating) disputes, such as "who is the most moe" or "who is the best girl".

###How does it work?

Each bracket has a few distinct phases:

- *Nominations* - During the nominations phase, users are allowed to nominate characters into the bracket. The creator of the bracket uses this time to allow nominees into the bracket or reject them.
- *Eliminations* - Eliminations is used to pare down the all the original nominees into those that will enter the bracket. Currently, only powers of 2 are supported (8, 16, 32, 64, etc), so this gives ample opportunity to get the total down to a reasonable number. Additionally, these votes are used to determine the [seeding order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_\(sports\)) of the final bracket.
- *Voting* - Once all the prep work is done in the nomination and elimination phases, voting proper begins. This part is straight forward: the entrants with the higher number of votes are moved to the next round until only one entrant remains.

###What happens if there's a tie?

In the chance that a round ends in a tie between two characters, the character with the higher seed will be chosen as the victor.
