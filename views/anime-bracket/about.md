##About Anime Bracket

###What is it?

As the name suggest, Anime Bracket exists to hold single-elimination style tournaments with characters from various Japanese media (despite the name, it doesn't _need_ to be anime). It's great for settling (or creating) disputes, such as "who is the most moe" or "who is the best girl".

###How does it work?

Each bracket has a few distinct phases:

- *Nominations* - During the nominations phase, users are allowed to nominate characters into the bracket. The bracket's creator uses this time to allow nominees into the bracket or reject them.
- *Eliminations* - Eliminations is used to pare down the all the original nominees into those that will enter the bracket. Currently, only powers of 2 are supported (8, 16, 32, 64, etc), so this gives ample opportunity to get the total down to a reasonable number. Additionally, these votes are used to determine the [seeding order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_\(sports\)) of the final bracket.
- *Voting* - Once all the prep work is done in the nomination and elimination phases, voting proper begins. This part is straight forward: the entrants with the higher number of votes are moved to the next round until only one entrant remains.

###What happens if there's a tie?

In the chance that a round ends in a tie between two characters, the character with the higher seed will be chosen as the victor.

###So, are there any rules about what I can do with a bracket?

There are indeed a few rules around creating brackets to keep this site an upstanding citizen of the internet:

- Images must be _mostly_ safe for work, meaning no pictures of exposed nipples or genitals. Any offending imagery will be removed and, if there's too much offending content, the bracket may be deleted outright.
- Brackets _must_ be focused around Japanese media which includes (but is not limited to): anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, video games (of Japanese origin), and characters. Cosplay of any of the aforementioned items is also acceptable.
